\section{ Purpose}

The final stage of the project lifecycle is termination or closure of the project.This stage tells all about the entire development process followed during the course of the project. It also includes the experiences of the team in making of the project, the mistakes made during the course of the project and also lessons learnt by making those mistakes. So, in a way it describes the entire journey from the feasibility analysis to the final acceptance of the project. It helps to evaluate the success of the project. The termination analysis report will thus serve as a reference for other project teams at the starting phase of their projects, so that they can get to know the approach followed by the project team, how much efficient and systematic the approach was and what needs to be avoided so that the mistakes made by the team are not repeated by other teams.
\subsection{Scope}
Terminal Analysis Report’s scope is to describe the closure of the making of
Strategian application. It comprises of the elements of review process involved after the completion of the project.\\
This document can indeed be used to study the entire development process
involved behind the project and can be very well used as a reference for team starting to build new projects.

\section{Deviations}
During the development of the project, there were few unintentional deviations from the actual plan and expectation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The primary reason for deviating from the timeline is lack of experience in developing this kind of product.
  \item There were points where Difference of opinions on creating a document/product took a little long time to reach the consensus than expected.
\end{itemize}
\section{Lessons Learnt}
During the development processes of this product we have learnt many lessons some of them are as follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item We learnt Android application development and Web application as well as various tools and technologies like RUP, GitHub, etc.We also learnt basics of Django framework.
  \item When we have a less experienced team, it is always better to take guidance from experts in the area so that we can plan accordingly.
  \item Our team haven’t all requirement skill sets to be used in the project. In order to overcome this, skill development should be started early, before going into design or Coding phase.
  \item Need to start work on time to meet deadlines and to handle deadline pressures.
  \item Requirement Gathering phase and Designing phase should be given more
importance so that coding phase becomes easy and the quality of the end-product improves greatly.
\item Our team leader and leaders of different departments learnt
leadership qualities and how to manage team and sub-teams.
\end{itemize}
\section{Future Scope of the Project}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Our Product can be implemented in daily purpose of our college students to solve existing problem like Scheduling Time Table , Polling and Library Sysytem.
  \item Further, it can be impliment to other colleges also and with some Extra Features .
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Taking this project was a wonderful experience. There were many skills which we
learnt during the course of the project. Many a times, important decisions
needed to be taken. More importantly, we learnt the systematic approach of
developing a software product and that too in a timely and cost effective
manner. Apart from the learning of new skills, there was a lot of good exposure in
areas of time management, team work, team management etc. Lastly, it gave
hands on experience of building the first software product, which we will cherish
for a long time.\\~\\
